# itp348_Fa23Proj
This is my final project for ITP-348 in Fall 2023

## Project Info
This project was compiled with the ParticleIO Workbench extension in VSCode, so folders like `.vscode` or `.github` were generated by the extension upon the creation of the project.

See the Documentation folder for more information about the project itself. (The project deliverables included a developer and user version of the documentation, so there are two PDFs in that folder.)

## Note on Libraries
Both folders within the main `src` folder use the same two libraries (installed with the ParticleIO Workbench extension): `ADXL345_Sparkfun_Particle` and `ArduinoJson`.

[SparkFun_ADXL345_Particle_Library](https://github.com/reparke/SparkFun_ADXL345_Particle_Library) was forked from [SparkFun_ADXL345_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ADXL345_Arduino_Library) by my professor since the class was working with Particle Argons instead of Arduinos (both of these libraries are open-source).

The `accel_calib.cpp` file in my project is a modified version of SparkFun_ADXL345_Particle_Library's calibration example, so I noted the original source in my file (the only modification after the project's due date of December 8, 2023).

[ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)'s license file can be found in its library folder.
